                <h1>BIO</h1>
                Kyrie Andrew Irving was born in 1992 in Melbourne, Australia. His father, Drederick, was playing
                professional ball in Australia for the Bulleen Boomers when Kyrie was born. Before the Boomers,
                Drederick played college ball for Boston University, where they retired his jersey. Kyrie holds dual
                citizenship in both Australia and the United States. His godfather is former NBA player Rod Strickland.
                Irving his high school ball in New Jersey, starting with two seasons at Montclair Kimberley Academy
                before transferring to St. Patrick High School. After his senior season at St. Patrick, Irving was named
                a McDonald's All-American and a First Team All-American by Parade Magazine and USA Today. During his pro
                career, Irving took on the role of "Uncle Drew" for soda advertisements and an eventual movie that was
                filled with NBA stars. His favorite book is "Catcher in the Rye." Fans can follow the exciting point
                guard on both Twitter and Instagram @KyrieIrving. Irving's time at Duke was brief and glorious. He
                appeared in 11 games during his lone season as a Blue Devil, but averaged 17.5 points on 53.2 percent
                from the field and 5.4 assists for the 2010-11 squad. After eight games, the point guard injured his big
                toe in a Dec. 4 game against Butler. A game before getting injured, he had put the nation on notice with
                a season-high 31 points, six rebounds and four assists in a win over Michigan State. The New Jersey
                native had helped the Blue Devils go undefeated in the early season, but missed more than three months
                of the season due to the injury. He returned prior to the NCAA tournament and came off the bench in
                relief of Seth Curry. The 6-1 guard helped Duke survive with first weekend in wins over Hampton (14
                points) and Michigan (11 points). Irving delivered 28 points in Duke's Sweet 16 loss to the Derrick
                Williams-led Arizona Wildcats.
                College Career
                Kyrie Irving committed to Duke University on October 22, 2009, he played with the Blue Devils during the
                2010-2011 season under the head coach Mike Kryzewski. Through the first eight games of the season, he
                averaged 17.4 points per game on 53.2% shooting, 5.1 assists, 3.8 rebounds and 1.5 steals. In the season
                that he played he was a strong contender for NCAA Freshmen of the Year until he suffered a severe
                ligament injury in his right big toe during the ninth game of the season. On March 17th, Kyrie returned
                for his first game back since his devastating injury. Duke advanced to the Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA
                Tournament that year but lost to Arizona, in which Kyrie scored 28 points in that game. That game also
                turned out to be Kyrie's last game playing for the Blue Devils.

            Kyrie Irving, popularly known as “Kai” and “Uncle Drew,” is an American professional basketball player who
            plays for the Dallas Mavericks. Irving was considered to be a basketball prodigy from his high school days.
            Starting off his basketball career at Montclair Kimberley Academy and St. Patrick High School, Irving left
            scouts and college programs awestruck by his ability. By the end of his high school career, he was a
            five-star recruit.

            the rim and make tough jumpers, Irving’s playoff performances are scripted with moments of brilliance. He
            has the ability to elevate his game come playoff time. Almost always scoring in double figures, Irving is
            known to be an offensive powerhouse who has a very positive impact on all the teams he has played for. His
            performance in the 2016 NBA Finals against the Golden State Warriors was undeniably pivotal, with Irving
            hitting the game winning 3-pointer in the dying seconds.
            As of May 2024, Kyrie Irving has played 82 playoff games, winning 55. Primarily credited for his

            thrive under moments of pressure.
            Kyrie Irving has reached the conference finals thrice as of May 2024. He won all three times. All Irving’s
            conference finals victories came when he was with the Cavaliers. His most notable conference finals
            performance occurred in the 2015/16 NBA season, where the Cavaliers faced off against the Toronto Raptors.

            <b>2018–2019: All-NBA Second Team selection</b><br>
            In the Celtics' season opener on October 16, Irving played in his first game since March and had seven
            points and seven assists in a 105–87 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers. Irving missed his first nine
            attempts from the field and did not score until finally connecting on a pair of free throws early in the
            third quarter.[110] On October 30, after averaging 14 points through the first six games, he scored 31
            points in a 108–105 victory over the Detroit Pistons.[111] On November 8, Irving scored 18 of his
            then-season-high 39 points in the fourth quarter and overtime of the Celtics' 116–109 victory over the
            Phoenix Suns.[112] On November 16, he recorded a season-high 43 points and 11 assists in a 123–116 overtime
            victory over the Toronto Raptors. It marked Irving's first ever game scoring at least 40 points with 10 or
            more assists, and became the first Celtics player to do so since Antoine Walker in 2001.[113] On December
            12, Irving scored 38 points in a 130–125 overtime victory over the Washington Wizards.[114] On December 25,
            he recorded 40 points and 10 rebounds in a 121–114 overtime win over the 76ers.[115] On December 29, he
            scored 22 of his 26 points in the second half of the Celtics' 112–103 win over the Memphis Grizzlies.
            Irving's 13 assists matched his season best and was one short of his career high.[116] On January 16, 2019
            Irving recorded 27 points and a career-high 18 assists in a 117–108 victory over the Raptors.[117]

            On January 21, Irving had a career-high eight steals in a 107–99 win over the Miami Heat.[118] Five days
            later, he recorded 32 points and 10 assists in a 115–111 loss to the Golden State Warriors. It was Irving's
            11th double-double with points and assists, becoming the first Celtic with 11 of that kind of double-double
            since Larry Bird in 1986–87. It was also Irving's sixth straight game with at least 25 points, matching the
            longest such streak in his career.[119] On March 14, he recorded his second career triple-double with 31
            points, 12 assists, and 10 rebounds in a 126–120 victory over the Sacramento Kings, becoming the first
            Celtics player to record 30-plus points and a triple-double in the same game since Rajon Rondo in February
            2012.[120] Two days later, Irving had 30 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists in a 129–120 win over the
            Atlanta Hawks.[121] In his first playoff game as a Celtic, Irving became just third player in franchise
            history (joining Isaiah Thomas in 2015 and Jo Jo White in 1972) to have 20-plus points, five-plus assists
            and five-plus rebounds in his postseason debut with the team, helping Boston defeat the Indiana Pacers 84–74
            in game one of their first-round series.[122] In Game 2 of the series, Irving scored 37 points in a 99–91
            victory.[123] In Game 1 of the second round, Irving had 26 points and a playoff career high-tying 11 assists
            in a 112–90 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks.[124] The Celtics would lose the next four games and the series
            to the Bucks.<br>

            <b> Brooklyn Nets (2019–2023)</b><br>
            2019–2020: Debut and injury<br>
            On July 7, 2019, Irving signed with the Brooklyn Nets in free agency.[125] On October 23, 2019, he debuted
            for the Nets with 50 points, eight rebounds, and seven assists in a 127–126 overtime loss to the Minnesota
            Timberwolves, becoming the first player in NBA history to score 50 points or more in a team debut.[126]
            Irving became the seventh player in franchise history to score 50 points or more in a single game, and joins
            Stephon Marbury (2001) as the only one to also record 15 combined rebounds and assists.[127][128] Irving
            also scored 25 of the Nets' 56 points in the first half.[129]

            Irving missed 26 games due to a right shoulder injury, and returned on January 12, 2020, scoring 21 points
            on a 10-of-11 shooting in the 108–86 victory over the Atlanta Hawks.[130][131] On January 25, he scored 45
            points, also recording six rebounds and seven assists, to lead Brooklyn to a 121–111 overtime victory over
            the Detroit Pistons.[132] The next day, the Nets were scheduled to play the New York Knicks at Madison
            Square Garden, but Irving left the arena prior to tip-off upon learning of the death of Kobe Bryant.[133] On
            January 31, Irving scored a season-high 54 points on 19-of-23 shooting in a 133–118 victory over the Chicago
            Bulls.[134] On February 20, it was announced that he would undergo season-ending surgery on his injured
            shoulder.
            <br><br>
            <b>2020–2021: 50–40–90 season</b><br>
            In the Nets' season opener on December 22, Irving had 25 points, four assists, and four rebounds in a 125–99
            victory over the Golden State Warriors.[137] Three days later, he had 37 points and eight assists in a
            123–95 victory over his former team, the Boston Celtics.[138] On February 18, 2021, Irving was named an
            Eastern Conference starter for the 2021 NBA All-Star Game, his seventh selection.[139] On May 6, Irving had
            a season-high 45 points in a 113–109 loss to the Dallas Mavericks.[140] At the end of the regular season, he
            became the ninth player in NBA history to join the 50–40–90 club, representing the shooting percentages from
            the field (.506), the three-point line (.402), and the free throw line (.922). Irving also became only the
            fourth player to average over 25.0 points, while making the 50–40–90 club, the others being Stephen Curry,
            Kevin Durant, and Larry Bird.
            Irving sprained his right ankle after landing on Giannis Antetokounmpo's foot during Game 4 of the
            Conference Semifinals against the Milwaukee Bucks, and missed Game 5.[142] The Nets lost the series in seven
            games.

            <b>2021–2022: Playoff disappointment</b>
            <br><br>

            Irving in 2022
            On October 12, 2021, the Nets' general manager Sean Marks announced that Irving would be ineligible to play
            or practice with the team, due to the New York City COVID-19 vaccine mandate, until being
            vaccinated.[144][145] Despite remaining unvaccinated, on December 17, following a large number of players
            lost to injuries and health and safety protocols, as well as an inordinate minutes load on Kevin Durant and
            James Harden, the Nets announced that Irving would return to the team as a part-time player for games
            outside of the New York area and Toronto.[146] On January 5, 2022, Irving made his season debut, recording
            22 points, three rebounds, and four assists, on 9-of-17 shooting in 31 minutes in a 129–121 victory over the
            Indiana Pacers.[147]

            It was speculated that Irving was originally on the NBA 75th Anniversary Team which was announced on October
            21, 2021, as the Brooklyn Nets prematurely posted an announcement congratulating him on the achievement, but
            was later excluded, allegedly due to the ongoing vaccine mandate controversy.[148][149] Former teammate
            LeBron James later said, "Damn shame he ain’t Top 75!", as did Andre Iguodola, "So y'all saying Kyrie Irving
            ain't top 75? I agree… he top 20 at least…" in Twitter posts.[150][151] Irving himself, sports commentators,
            and fans criticized the exclusion due to Irving's already illustrious career at the time of the
            list.[152][153][154]

            On February 26, 2022, Irving scored a then season-high 38 points with five rebounds, five assists, and two
            steals in a 126–123 victory over the reigning champions Milwaukee Bucks.[155] In February 2022, New York
            City mayor Eric Adams announced that the city would be lifting its vaccine requirement for indoor activities
            on March 7.[156] However, Irving remained subject to a different workplace vaccine mandate that remained in
            place.[157] In a public statement, Adams said that making a specific exemption for Irving would "send the
            wrong message" to other people employed in the city.[158]

            On March 8, Irving scored a then season-high 50 points on 15-of-19 shooting from the field and delivered six
            assists in a 132–121 win over the Charlotte Hornets. He became only the second guard in NBA history (after
            Michael Jordan) who would have multiple 50-point games while shooting 75 percent from the floor.[159] A week
            later, Irving scored 41 of his career-high and Nets franchise-record 60 points in the first half, grabbed
            six rebounds, delivered four assists along with four steals on 20-of-31 shooting from the field, including
            eight three-pointers, in a 150–108 victory over the Orlando Magic.[160] On March 23, Mayor Adams announced
            that the city would be relaxing its COVID-19 vaccine mandate, allowing Irving to play at the Barclays
            Center.[161] On March 27, Irving made his home debut against the Charlotte Hornets, scoring 16 points in 41
            minutes, in a 119–110 loss.[162]

            On April 12, Irving, in his first play-in appearance, scored 34 points and dished out 12 assists in a
            115–108 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers to secure the #7 seed in the playoffs.[163] In Game 1 of the
            first round of the playoffs, Irving scored a game-high 39 points along with five rebounds, six assists, and
            4 steals in a narrow 115–114 loss to the Boston Celtics.[164] He was fined $50,000 on April 19 for middle
            finger gestures and profane language to fans in Boston during that game.[165] Brooklyn would go on to lose
            to Boston in four games, and Irving was swept for the first time in his career
